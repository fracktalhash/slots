### 4. ‚òÅÔ∏è  Port into GCP Resume Challenge
- [ ] Turn game logic into backend microservice (FastAPI)
- [ ] Host frontend on GCP Cloud Run or App Engine
- [ ] Store game state in Firestore
- [ ] Secure game endpoints and track session data

## ‚öñÔ∏è Symbol Weights

Symbols are weighted differently to simulate rarity:

### 3x3 Slot Weights
| Symbol                  | Weight |
|-------------------------|--------|
| ‚ô• / ‚ô† / Œî / Œ©           | 0.13   |
| Œ® / ‚ôù / ‚ôû / ‚ôú / ‚ôõ       | 0.07   |
| ‚ôö                       | 0.02   |

### 3x4 Slot Weights
| Symbol              | Weight |
|---------------------|--------|
| ‚ô• / ‚ô†               | 0.3    |
| Œî / Œ© / Œ®           | 0.1    |
| ‚ôù / ‚ôû               | 0.025  |
| ‚ôú / ‚ôõ               | 0.005  |
| ‚ôö                   | 0.002  |

The lower the weight, the rarer the symbol ‚Äî and the bigger the reward.
